# Quick Start

1. Save [quine.html][1] to your computer.
2. Open in a browser (preferably FireFox).
3. *Optional:* Install the [TiddlyWiki for Firefox add-on][2] to enable saving to your hard drive. Otherwise changes can only be persisted to your browser's local storage.

# Quine.html is a local, single page application

Quine.html is an HTML file that can save itself! A single html file, containing both the data and the logic, can be opened, executed, and saved locally without access to the internet. 

- Single page applications that persist changes may be be developed on top of this foundation.
- Requires the [TiddlyWiki for Firefox add-on][2] for full functionality.
- The [TaskPaper format][3] is used to organize the text/data/code internally, but is not a strict requirement.


# Motivation

I want to make a file that is:

- easy to read and edit in a plain text editor
- *and* allows advanced features when opened in a browser

Advanced features could be:

- Graphical visualization of the file contents (i.e. colors, graphs, or even 3D)
- Interactivity (i.e. making URL's clickable; buttons to sort/modify text)
- Automation (i.e. automatically sorting lists when new items added)

[Todo.html][4] was my first attempt at this. I wanted to improve on the the idea of a text-based todo list that is managed from the command line. I thought the browser was even more ubiquitous than the command line terminal and offered the potential to create a better interface.
