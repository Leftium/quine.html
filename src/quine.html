Welcome to TaskPaper.html: the file that edits and saves itself!:
  For best results, open in FireFox with the TiddlyFox extension.(Other browsers are partially supported.)
  Of course, you can also edit/view this file from your favorite application that supports TaskPaper (or plain text) files.
	Just avoid modifying the "Metadata" project, which contains the HTML/CSS/JavaScript magic.

Get Started with the TaskPaper format:
  TaskPaper knows about four things: projects, tasks, notes, and tags.
  - To create a task, type a line starting witha  dash followed by a space.
  - To create a project, type a line ending with a colon.
  - Any line that isn't a task or project is a note.
  - To create a tag, type '@' followed by a name anywhere in a project, task, or note.
  You use these basic parts in any way you like. TaskPaper doesn't force a
  particular system on you; it provides the basic to-do list elements and then
  you use them as you see fit.

Project A:
  Note II
  - Task 2.1
    Note III
    - Sub-task 2.2
      Note IV

Project B:
  - Task 3.1
    - Sub-Task 3.2
